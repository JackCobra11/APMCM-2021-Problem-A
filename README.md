# APMCM-2021-Problem-A
没参加这次比赛，试了下用PY写了第一小问，不知道对不对，可以再添加个滚动条设置Threshold。
对于Edge Detecting，还可以用Mathematica的EdgeDetect。

## Problem A
## Image Edge Analysis and Application
With the development of science and technology, the demand for measurement accuracy of
various workpieces and parts is getting higher and higher, and the requirements for
measurement instruments are also getting more and more demanding. Various image measuring
equipment such as digital image size measuring instrument are now gradually replacing the
traditional manual caliper measurement application. Generally, after the camera is calibrated,
based on the the dot matrix or checkerboard feature information of the calibrated image, the
image can be corrected for distortion and the mapping relationship between the image
coordinate space and the world coordinate space can be calculated.
